# BashScriptsPublic
This is a collection of my bash scripts I have created, whether it be in class, internship, or personally.

# IMPORTANT
These are executable scripts that could cause changes to files and other data on your device. I do not recommend running some of these scripts. 

These bash scripts were made using a Linux operating system, and are meant to run on a Linux-based OS.

You may view the code via the GitHub GUI.

I have provided these explicitly to showcase my skills.
